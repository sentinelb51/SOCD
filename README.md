# SOCD-Last-Input-Priority
An extremely simple AutoHotKey (AHK) script that simulates software-based Simultaneous Opposite Cardinal Direction (SOCD) resolution

## Warning
Modifying inputs with AHK is generally detectable by most anti-cheats; you use this at your own risk as you may get banned for using this software.
So far it has been tested in Overwatch 2 without any issues, but use with caution regardless.

## Downloads
There are compiled and non-compiled (script) versions of this. **Use the compiled version if you wish to improve responsiveness.**
This is not as fast as hardware-based SOCD (such as Wooting or Razer's implementations), so I recommend using the compiled version. **You may need AHK installed for the non-compiled version.**
